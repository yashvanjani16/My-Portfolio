11. var counter = Model.SourceItem.GetChildren().IndexOf(item) + 1;

12. Condition to check if "Hide from list" checkbox is checked or not
    @foreach(var item in Model.SourceItem.GetChildren().ToList().Where(x => x["Hide From List"] != "1")){

    Condition to check template name within foreach
    @foreach (var item in Model.SourceItem.GetChildren().ToList().Where(x => x.Template.Name == "Report Builder Navigation")){
	
    Condition to apply parameters within foreach
    @foreach(var item in Model.SourceItem.GetChildren().ToList().OrderByDescending(x=> x["Date"])){

13. #Sitepath#homepage|#FILEPATH#

14. always set date field with date with timezone (template)

15. For rss feed:
   1. check items which are alertable then create rss (to check which items are alertable refer email alerts from t&f or ask bpm)
   2. check checkbox when items are not accessible(to link it to parent template ) [not accessible in the sense items does not redirect to somewhere]	

16. @Html.Raw(@Html.Sitecore().Field("Title",Model.SourceItem).ToString().Trim().ToLower().Replace(" ","-"))
    This will change:
    Abc Xyz to abc-xyz
    So, such string manipulation can be done directly in site rendering

17. string footerLogoUrl = @Html.MIS().Url("Footer Logo", @chunkField).ToString();
    string arImage = @Html.MIS().Url("Image", @chunkField).ToString();
    <img src="@arImage" alt="Annual Report Image" />                                        (dynamic alt tag of img syntax reference - playtech and hg)

18. yt video id = D0UnqGm_miA
    vimeo video id = 89489427 , 813537316


19.This happen when you use third party APIs, in which $ is used so you have to change all occurances of $ with $j,

Find	Replace
$	$j
$(	$j(
$.	$j.
$[	$j[

20. new {CharLimit="160"}  WordLimit="12"  new {DisableWebEdit = true}:-
    @Html.MIS().TextField("Title" ,Model.SourceItem, new{WordLimit="12"})
    @Html.MIS().TextField("Intro Text" ,Model.SourceItem, new{CharLimit="200" , ContinueNotation="..."})

21. For getting item count in list control
@Model.InnerListItems.Count
 
For getting item count in general control
@Model.SourceItem.GetChildren().Count

22. Sitecore.Data.Items.Item parentItem = Sitecore.Context.Database.GetItem("{395F5889-03DD-40A5-A6F4-C1CA280F8F50}");
 
    var totalCount= @parentItem.GetChildren().Count()

23. Total count / length
 
    @innerItem.Children.Count
    @innerItem.InnerListItems.Count
    @Model.TotalCount
    @Model.SourceItem.Children.ToArray().Length

    If in general component:
    @Model.SourceItem.Children.ToArray().Length

    Length check in multilist : 
var counter = 1;
typeDetails = ((Sitecore.Data.Fields.MultilistField)item.Fields["Type"]).GetItems().Where(thisItem => thisItem != null).ToList();

<type><![CDATA[@foreach (var typeitem in typeDetails){        
          if(@typeDetails.Count == counter){
          var t = typeitem.Name;
          @t;
          }
          else{
          var t = typeitem.Name + ",";
          @t;
          }
          counter++;
        }]]></type>

24.// Check if the language version exists for the page
Sitecore.Globalization.Language language = Sitecore.Globalization.Language.Parse(Sitecore.Context.Language.ToString());
Item pageItem = Sitecore.Context.Database.GetItem(PageId, language);
 
if (pageItem.Versions.Count > 0)
{
    // Execute corresponding code
}

25. var bannerImgUrl = !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(@bannerImg) ? Html.MIS().Url(new UrlParameters{Name="Banner Image"}).ToString() : "";     -    Working proper in banner control but throwing error in general control

To do list for best practices:
1: Add values in standard values (parent and child whichever have fields) - TEMPLATE SECTION
2: Associate rendering link in standard values of parent template and give id of of template in site rendering (parent template ,not standard values id)
3: Producers,
Never use image provided by designer directly.
Open them in photoshop and optimise it first then upload and use. Also image without transparency should be used only jpeg as png is heavy in size.
4: Wherever A tag is used always make it not selfservable using : new {DisableWebEdit = true}.

New workflow with the new base site:

* Search result page template creation will be required now.
* Delete field using right clicking physical field item.
* Module having child items : branch should be created.
* Now direct renderings under site-name-modules and no folders for rendering categorization.
* Now third party js and css should be added in head section along with other required things such as security related script, gtm script etc...

Self-serve checkpoints and standard workflow.

* Create templates
* Create rendering
* Create respective branches (If child items are there)
* Set proper configure assign values (with branches if any).
* Add rendering id in respective template's "Associate rendering" field.
* "Data source template" Field in rendering (Content) (Add respective template id here).
* Create rendering for self-serve and assign it to the child item.
* Set proper std values in templates along with proper placeholder images with desired dimensions.
* Use disable web edit = true at all required places.
* Hide unwanted fields from self-serve using "Hide fields from self-serve settings".
* Add your renderings in placeholder settings.
* Async rendering and partial rendering should be "Editable: false" (Unchecked).
* Keep rendering icon and its template icon same.
* Create "Hide from list" checkbox for template used for list control rendering and check if it is working or not.
* Create "Hide from list" checkbox for template used for controls other than list control rendering and write coding to hide it and check if it is working or not.
* Don't create sliders in self-serve mode.

JIRA workflow enhancement.
Below is the checklist as of now we can add/remove items later.
•	Responsive behavior completed across the devices
•	Pixel perfect completed and screenshot attached
•	Lazy load added to applicable images
•	Responsive images used to applicable images
•	Functional specification points covered as per Figma
•	X-Browser, No Js is implemented
•	Accessibility covered as per level given in E&P
•	Self-serve check completed as per checklist.
•	QA Ignore points added
•	Jira is ready with the information required for QA
